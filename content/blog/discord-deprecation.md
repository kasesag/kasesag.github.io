Starting from the 1st of May, I will remove my Discord username/tag from my personal home page. Furthermore, I will not accept any future friend requests since they will be disabled. 

If you want to get in touch with me, please refer to section **Contact & Socials** at the **Home** page. I prefer encrypted communication, so the easiest option is matrix. If you can't use matrix for some reason, then write me an e-mail (preferably gpg signed).

And If you still want to hesitate me to use discord, then write me an e-mail and the real reason why do you want to use discord instead. I don't always guarantee I will accept discord as a mean of communication as It doesn't have E2E Encryption, and I hardly check it nowadays.
