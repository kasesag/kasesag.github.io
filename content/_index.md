## Hello there!
I'm kasesag, and I'm a 19-year-old guy who loves science, computing, hacking & LGBTQ folks 🏳️‍🌈

I'm mainly into tinkiering with computers and I really like to program in C, Rust & Python. I may also use other languages in various projects. I also like to tinker with microcontrollers & electronics in general. 

Furthermore, I'm also keen on UNIX-like operating systems (such as Linux or NetBSD), and I virtually use them everywhere!

## Projects
All of my most interesting projects are not currently public. Maybe you can find some on my github profile...
